## Accessibility Overview
Good accessibility or "a11y" is crucial to making sure all users can access the content in your sites and applications. We often shorten the word "**accessibility**" to "**a11y**" because there's 11 letters between the "A" and "Y" in the word "Accessibility". Making sure you consider accessibility at the start of your process will ensure that your final product is more polished and works for more people.
When we say a site to be accessible, we're saying that the site's content to be available to everyone  and functionality can be operated by anyone. This includes users who are experiencing some type of impairment or disability and it makes absolutely no difference whether that impairment is situational, temporary or permanent. Accessibility is really about making sure that the content and the websites we create is usable to people with various impairments or abilities. Addressing accessibility issues very often improves the user experience for everyone.

Some statistics on disability for the US:
* Around 2% of the population has some kind of vision disability.
* Around 50% of the population has some kind of clinically significant refractive error.
* Around 8% of males and 0.5% of females have some form of color vision deficiency.
* Around 2% of adults have a hearing disability.
* Over 4% have a cognitive disability.

Modern web technologies make it very easy for a developer to create a website that's difficult for someone who is blind to use. If a user has no vision, it's quite likely they would be using a **screen reader**, which is a software that allows them to hear the information displayed on the screen via a text to speech synthesizer. They may also be using **Braille** which allows them to feel the on-screen text with their fingers when using braille display.
Many websites are visual in their nature and lack **keyboard navigation** which is essential for blind people to be able to navigate through the content. In general, it is safe to assume that there are more people with visual impairments, that is people who have some sight, as opposed to people who are completely blind. There are also people with low visual acuity. And they may be using **large print text or magnification** when using the computer. Other people might have poor color vision who may have difficulty distinguishing red and green or blue and yellow account for 9% of male and 1% of female.

We may also find ourselves with **temporary challenges**, such as when trying to use a computer in the sun or looking at a dodgy projector.
Whenever accessibility comes up in a conversation, people tend to picture someone who is blind but there are actually more impairments to think about and consider. There is a huge number of people with **motor or dexterity impairments**. Such users may be using only the keyboard, head or eye tracking software, switches, voice dictation etc. By catering to users with permanent dexterity impairments, we ensure a great experience for everyone.

There are also users with **hearing impairments**. For example, some may be completely deaf, yet others have some hearing. The content that uses sound should provide some kind of visual alternative. For example, a messenger app could be using a flashing alert as well as sound notifications.

There are also users with **cognitive impairments**, for example ADD, dyslexia or autism. These users may require diverse accommodations, such as zooming the screen to make it easier to read the content, or minimal design to minimize distraction and cognitive load.

Experienced screen reader users have it speaking really fast. As a beginning user you tend to listen at much lower speeds. But as you gain efficiency with the screen reader, you will find that making it speak faster improves efficiency when browsing content on websites. ChromeVox Lite, is a minimal version of ChromeVox but functioning screen reader written in JavaScript.

The **WCAG or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0** is a set of guidelines and best practices which have been put together by accessibility experts to try and answer the question of what accessibility means in a methodical way. Several countries actually mandate the use of these guidelines in their web accessibility legal requirements. WCAG is organized around **four core principles**, together it forms **POUR**.
* Make the content **perceivable** for all users. Just because something is perceivable with one sense such as sight, that doesn't mean that all users can perceive it.
* Make the content **operable** so all users can use UI components and navigate the content. For example, something which requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can't use a mouse or is using a touchscreen.
* Is the content **understandable**? Can all users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion?
* Is it **robust** enough for the content to be consumed by a wide variety of user agents? Does it work with assistive technology?

While WCAG provides an extremely comprehensive set of guidelines to help us keep many facets of accessibility in mind, it can also be a bit overwhelming. To help mitigate this, the WebAIM Group has distilled the WCAG guidelines down into an easy to follow checklist, targeted specifically for web content. The **WebAIM checklist** can give you a short high level summary of what you need to implement while also linking to the underlying or tag specifications if you need an expanded definition.
Both WCAG and the checklist cover a lot of the accessibility space. The guidelines can only ever be a limited proxy for actual accessibility, what actually matters is the user experience. So while these guidelines give us a framework for thinking about accessibility, there may be places where they're incomplete or even give advice which is a little out of date. However, they're still an excellent resource for helping us integrate accessibility into our process. With these tools in hand we can chart a direction for our accessibility work, be confident that so long as our project is meeting the outlined criteria, our users should have a positive experience.

## Focus
Focus refers to the control on the computer screen that receives input from the keyboard and from the clipboard when you paste. Most are probably familiar with focus for text fields. In order to type in a text field you first have to go over with your mouse and **click** on it. That act of clicking on the text field, that's actually what focuses it. Some users drive the computer entirely with the keyboard or some other type of discrete input device. For those users, focus is absolutely critical. It's their primary means of reaching everything on the screen. And so for that reason the Web AIM checklist states in section 2.1.1, that all page functionality should be available using the keyboard, unless it's something you couldn't normally do with a keyboard like free hand drawing. The work that we do today on focus is actually an important primer for supporting assistive technology users.

Focus determines where keyboard events go in the page. The currently focused item is often indicated by a **focus ring**, where the actual styling of that ring depends on the browser and any additional styling that the page author may have applied. As a user, you can control which element is currently focused using your keyboard. Move focus around the page using your keyboard:

* **TAB** move focus forward.
* **SHIFT - TAB** move focus backwards.
* **Arrow keys** move focus within a component.

On macOS, this works a little differently. While Chrome will always let you navigate with Tab, you'll need to press Option+Tab in order to change focus in other browsers like Safari. If you like, you can change this. When pressing the Tab key, the browser is going to navigate through all of the focusable elements on the page. This ordering is called the **tab order**. Built-in interactive HTML elements like input, button, and select are all **implicitly focusable**. Meaning that they're automatically inserted in the tab order and that they also have built-in keyboard event handling. Not all elements are focusable. There's generally no need to focus something if a user can't interact with it or provide it some sort of input.

Working with native elements is great for focus behavior, because they're automatically inserted into the tab order based on their position in the DOM. The tab order corresponds to the **DOM order**. Now it's important to note that using something like CSS, it's possible to have things appear in one order on screen, but actually exist in a different order over in the DOM. So even though the visual order can change, the DOM order remains the same. Be careful when you're using something like CSS to visually change the position of your elements on screen. This can cause the tab order to jump around seemingly at random and for users relying on a keyboard this can be extremely confusing. For this reason the WebAIM checklist specifically states in section 1.3.2 that the reading and navigation order as determined by code order should be logical and intuitive in your application.

Because newly added elements are automatically inserted in the tab order, they can be very convenient to use. But there are instances when you'll want to modify the tab order. Like if you're building a component without a native analog, or if you need to have something off screen that should only be focusable when it appears, like perhaps a modal window. For these cases, you can use the **tabindex** attribute. Tabindex can be applied to any HTML element, and it takes a range of numeric values.

A tabindex of -1 means that the element will not be in the tab order, but it can be programmatically focused via JavaScript, by calling the element's **focus()** method. This can be especially useful for off screen content which appears on screen in response to a user event. When the new content is displayed, you may wish to call its focus() method which will then direct future keyboard events to it.

A tabindex of 0 will add the element to the natural tab order, plus that element will also be focusable  by calling its focus() method.

A tabindex of greater than zero, for instance something like tab index of 5 will jump the element to the front of the tab order regardless of where it is in the DOM. If there are multiple elements with a tabindex greater than zero, the order will start from the lowest value that is greater than zero and then work its way up. In general, using a tabindex greater than zero is discouraged and considered a bit of an anti-pattern. If you get in the habit of using it, you can quickly end up with a very jumbled tab order, and it can make things especially confusing for screen reader users who navigate the DOM in a linear fashion.

Ideally, if you need to put something earlier in the tab order, it's best to move it up in the DOM.

When you're starting to look at screen reader accessibility, it's tempting to add tab index to seemingly important elements like headers, in order to help out the user. That's actually counterproductive.
Normally, you only want to add focus behavior to **interactive controls** like buttons, tabs, drop downs, header links or anything that the user might provide input to.
If you're worried about visually impaired users missing out on your content, don't be.
So when you're adding a tab index attribute, stop and ask yourself, is this something the user is going to interact with? If the answer is no, you almost certainly want to leave it alone with a few exceptions.

You shouldn't add tab index to site content as a general rule but there is one exception to this and that's when you're manipulating the page, in response to a **user action**.
A scenario might be that a user goes and clicks on one of the menu items. The page then does an animated scroll down to that particular section. Or, if you are building a single page web app, clicking on one of the navigation links changes the content of the page without doing a full page refresh.
In either of these situations, you'll want to pick an appropriate header, give a tab index of negative one so it doesn't appear in the natural tab order and call its focus() method after the user has taken their action.
This process is known as **Managing Focus** and it's an extremely important technique that keeps the user's interactive context in sync with the visual representation of the site.
You should never remove the focus indicator from an interactive element unless you're going to replace it with something else. Otherwise a keyboard user might have no idea which element is currently focused!

On most websites the main content is usually not the first thing in the DOM. Instead we often begin with navigation, sublists, side bars, hamburger menus, and other bits of page scaffolding.
This means that keyboard and screen reader users must first navigate through all of this content before they can get at the actual heart of the page.
For users with motor impairments this is especially frustrating. Thankfully, there's an easy to implement solution.
Create a hidden link that allows keyboard and switch device users the ability to jump straight to our page content.
These links are often referred to as **skip links** and implementing them is actually really easy.

Managing focus when you navigate on the page is really important but sometimes you'll need to manage focus at the **component level** as well, especially if you're building a complex custom widget.
Knowing which keyboard behaviors to implement can be a bit of a guessing game but, thankfully there's a really helpful guide which you can refer to.
The **ARIA Authoring Practices doc (or "ARIA Design Patterns doc")** is a great resource for figuring out what kind of keyboard support your complex components should implement. It lists various kinds of components as well as the sorts of keyboard interactions that they support.

Check the Aria Design Patterns guide to determine what kind of keyboard support a component (for example radio group) needs.
Find the section which lists  all of the various components and their patterns. Look for a component that sort of matches the one you're building.
Based on the recommendations there are a number of keyboard handlers that needs to be implemented.

For building complex components **roving focus** is a really invaluable technique.

What do you do when you have content which isn't on screen yet, but still needs to be in the DOM?
A good example of this isa responsive drawer panel.
Now this is a really common UI pattern and it can present an interesting challenge for accessibility.
When you're building an application you might occasionally find that as you're tabbing around focus seems to suddenly just disappear.
Go into your console and log the documents activeElement, it gives you a reference to the currently focused item.
But another great option is to use the **Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools extension**.
This extension adds a number of useful features, including an inspector which will show you the accessibility properties of an element, as well as a set of accessibility audits.
You can find these by opening the Developer Tools and going to the Audits section.

Sometimes when you're working on managing focus, it can be possible to get a little carried away.
A **keyboard trap** is when keyboard focus is locked or trapped at one particular page element. This can be very frustrating for users.
In fact, Section 2.1.2 of the WebAIM checklist specifically calls this out. Stating, the keyboard focus should never be locked or trapped at any one particular page element.
The user should be able to navigate to and from all page elements using just their keyboard.
But strange as it may seem, there are times when this behavior is actually desirable.
Take for instance, the modal window, when it is displaying on screen, we don't want the user to be able to access any of the content behind it.
Oftentimes developers will add an overlay to cover the page, but that doesn't stop keyboard focus from accidentally traveling outside of the model.
In such instances we want to use a **temporary keyboard trap** to ensure that we track focus within the modal wall it's displaying.
And then that we can restore it to the previously focused item once the model is closed.
The **accessible model window** can be tricky element to implement.

## Semantics Basics
How do we build our websites to support users who can't see the screen at all?
**Assistive technology** are tools that are designed to help users whose impairments can prevent them from accessing information technology at all.
Assistive technology is an umbrella term for a broad range of devices, software and tools that help any person with a disability complete a task.
And assistive technology in particular is pretty blurry.
After all, all technologies are being built to assist people with some task or another, and things often move in and out of the assistive technology category.
On the other hand, technology which is general purpose often finds an assistive use.
In the context of web development we're still talking about a diverse range of technologies that we want to support.
People may interact with your website using a screen reader or braille display with a screen magnifier, via voice control, using a switch device, or some other form of assistive technology which adapts the page to create a more specific interface that they can use.
For all of these technologies, ensuring that our website support assistive technology uses is going to come down to **programmatically expressed semantics**.

When we use any manmade tool or device, we typically look to its form and design to give us an idea of what it does and how it works.
The fact that we've seen many similar things before gives us a visual clue.
When it comes to graphical user interfaces, **affordances** still represent the actions we can take.
But now they're more metaphorical since there's no physical object to interact with.
Some classic examples of technology affordances are buttons, you will be hard pressed to find any software UI without at least one button on it.
Think about how real world objects get translated into purely visual metaphors to create those affordance cues for graphical user interfaces.
For example, you can clearly see a button on a keyboard reflected in a button element and a checkbox on a ballot paper in a checkbox element.
While some graphical UI influences may not be immediately obvious to new users, people generally learn the visual cues quickly with little or no training.
Well designed affordances enable people to do something with as little training as possible.

Information needs to be expressed in a way which is flexible enough to be accessed programmatically by assistive technology. Which can then create an alternative user interface to suit its users needs.
We refer to this as expressing the **semantics of an element**.
The Web AIM WCAG 2.0 checklist explicitly calls this out in guideline 4.1.2, saying name, role, value, markup is used in a way that facilitates accessibility.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines go into a bit more detail. For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set.
A lot of the work we do to support screen readers also benefits users who use other assistive technologies.
Things like voice control and switch control use the same programmatically expressed semantics.

A screen reader actually largely creates the user interface for the user, based on the programatically expressed semantics.
Instead of a visual UI, a screen reader provides an auditory interface.
Roughly speaking, we can expect some subset of the following information to be expressed. What type of element it is? We call this an **elements role**.
Sometimes a screen reader might simply state the element's role. Other times it might play an easily recognizable sound to avoid constant repetition. Sometimes it might do both. The screen reader will announce an elements name, if it has one. It will announce what its value is, if it has one. And it will also announce any information it has about an element's state.
If we've done things right, we can expect to hear information about **an element's role, name, state, and value**.

If you're building a user interface for screen reading users only, you don't need to create
any visual UI at all. Just provide enough information for the screen reader to use.
For a screen reader user, the screen reader provides the affordances based on the role alone without caring about the visual style. This is more or less what the browser actually presents to the screen reader. The browser takes the DOM tree and modifies it to turn it into a form which is useful to assistive technology.
We refer to this modified tree as the **accessibility tree**. It conceptually looks a bit like an HTML page from the 90s.

The browser can transform the DOM tree into the a11y tree because much of the DOM has **implicit semantic meaning**. The DOM is using standard native HTML elements that are automatically recognized by browsers and work predictably on a variety of platforms.
A11y for native HTML elements such as the standard link or button, is handled automatically as well.
We can take advantage of that built in a11y by writing HTML which expresses the semantics of our page directly.

Screen readers will announce an element's role, name, state and value but not necessarily in that order. By using the right semantic element, we've got role, state and value covered, but we also need to make sure that we're making the elements name discoverable.
This is actually the very first item on WebAIMSs checklist, provide **text alternatives** for any non-text content.
There are two types of labels. **Visible labels**, which are used by all users to associate meaning with an element, and **text alternatives** which are only used when there's no need for visual labels. By its very nature a text alternative is usually not visible on the page.
The checklist provides a list of recommendations for how to create visible and non-visible labels.
The easiest is that form buttons have a descriptive value. A button typically has some text content and that acts as the button's text alternative.
Next is that form inputs have associated text labels. When we create a form input like a check box and just put some text next to it, we get a visual label, but we don't actually create a programmatically accessible label for the element we're trying to label. Also, we don't get the nice behavior where we can click on the label to total the check box.
We can fix this by using a **label element**. We can either wrap the input element or we can use the for attribute on the label. If we do that we need to make sure to give the input element an id and use the same id as the value of the for attribute. That creates an association between the label element and the input element.
Whichever of these two methods we use, we will get an accessible label for the check box, and we'll be able to total the check box by clicking the label.

We can use the alt attribute to provide a **text alternative for images**. However, we need to think about what role an image plays in the page to work out what type of text alternative it should have.
The **alt attribute** allows you to specify a simple string to be used whenever an image is not available, whether the image fails to load or you're a web crawling bot or a screen reader user. alt differs from any other type of caption, including a title, in that it will only be used if the image isn’t available. Caption or title typically provides extra contexts for the image, rather than an alternative to the image.
Writing useful alt text is a bit of an art. In order for a string to be a usable text alternative it needs to convey the same thing as the image in the given context.
An easy way to check whether your alt text is sensible is to imagine all your
images are broken. Can you still understand the page content?
Empty alt text actually removes images from the accessibility tree so they'll be skipped by the screen reader.
All images should have an alt attribute. Important images should have descriptive alt text that just describes what the image is. Decorative images should have blank alt text. The screen reader will skip that element completely. You want to include blank text because if you don't the screen reader may try to read the filename.

## Navigating Content
Writing semantic HTML already gives a lot of a11y out of the box.
Many people, when they start learning about screen readers, assume that it's so difficult and tedious to use. To compensate for their assumption, they tend to do things like making every element on the web page focusable so that a screen reader user has an easier time getting to them.
**VoiceOver** is a speech software that allows people who are blind or vision impaired to read information on the screen. It is built into Apple's macOS.
Screen readers provide a lot of shortcut keys, and one of those shortcut keys is a way to spell a specific word or even a sentence, letter by letter.

It's important to remember, that once you made the functionality of your web page accessible and usable for users of assistive technology, headings are probably one of the most important features you can build into your web pages, to make them more usable for screen reader users.

DOM order matters, which is also item 1.3.2 on the WebAIMs checklist. **Meaningful Sequence** states that the reading and navigation order (determined by code order) is logical and intuitive.
It matters for focus order, but it also matters for the order read by the screen reader.
Since the screen reader, like any assistive technology, is interacting with the accessibility tree, which is based directly on the DOM tree, the order a screen reader is going to perceive will be directly based on the DOM order.
Think of the page as perceived by desktop screen reader users at almost losing its second dimension. It's all serialized into a single stream of content. You can use a JavaScript snippet to list out the headings in the console.

Using headings to lay out page structures is mentioned in several WebAIMs checklist items.
**Section Headings** states that beyond providing an overall document structure, individual sections of content are designated using headings, where appropriate.
**Info and Relationships** states that semantic markup is used to designate headings, lists, emphasized or special text, etc.
**Bypass Blocks** states that if a page has a proper heading structure, this may be considered a sufficient technique instead of a "Skip to main content" link.

You can use techniques where some headings are placed off screen to make them visible only to screen reader users and other assistive technology.
For complex applications, this can be a good way to accommodate headings when the visual design doesn't require or even have room for a visible heading.
However, it's important not to go overboard with this technique.
Remember that assistive technology users may well be able to see the screen.
So going too far down the path of creating screen reader only content can actually create a worse user experience for some users.
It can also create a maintenance headache when it comes to things like internationalization.

It's also important that you don't fall into the trap of using heading tags just to achieve a particular look on the page.
Headings are used to improve the experience for screen reader users but there are other things you can use to navigate web pages.
VoiceOver and other screen readers, for example, allow to navigate by links, by form controls and landmarks.

VoiceOver can get you a list of links on a page, and even search through them.
This feature is obviously most useful if, firstly, the screen reader can find the links. Secondly, if the actual text of the links is meaningful.
There are three common link anti-patterns which can cause the screen reader to miss links in the page.
One is using a span with some link styling or an anchor tag without an href attribute.
For anything which behaves like a link, including within a single page application, you should absolutely use an anchor tag with an href attribute, no exceptions.
Not only will this make the link show up in the links list, but it will mean it automatically works with the keyboard and that you can do things like copy or bookmark the link location.
The second pattern is the opposite problem,
something which is implemented using a link but is really more like a button.
You can often recognize this by the href attribute being something nonsensical.
The third example is where we have an image used as link content. We can fix that by using our usual alt text technique to make sure the link is experienced directly to the assistive technology layout.
We also need to make sure that once the link makes it into the links list, that it's also useful. We do that by making sure its text is descriptive.
The checklist has a stronger and weaker version of this point. The stronger one, item 2.4.9 states that the purpose of each link should be determined from the link text alone.
In general, link text should give any user enough information to decide whether they want to click it. One common example of uninformative link text we see a lot these days is "learn more".
We can make it more useful by rewriting the text to say it something like "learn more about responsive layouts" or even making the paragraph heading as the link.

HTML5 introduced some new **semantic elements** which helps assistive technology understand how elements relate to one another.  
* *main* represents the main content of a page, typically there should only be one main element.
* *header* is either a page banner or else a grouping element for any introductory content at the start of any type of section. Using semantic elements allows us to express the same information while also potentially providing more information for screening ready users.
* *footer* may be either a page footer and contain information about the page or site. Or maybe a footer to a particular section of a page with extra information about that section.
* *nav* represents a section of a page that links to other pages like the top nav bar or to parts within the page like a table of contents.
* *article* is for self-contained sections of content like a blog entry, news article or forum post. A handy test for an article is whether its content would make sense in another context such as cross-posting a blog post to several different blogs.
* *section* is a completely generic section of a document or application. Since it doesn't really give much of a clue as to what its content might be, we typically include a heading inside as well.
* *aside* can be used for groups of nav elements and for other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page. It will often be rendered as a sidebar.

Make sure to use meaningful headings and link text as well as good page structure.
Secondly, as a general rule, you shouldn't try to control the experience a screen reader user will have.
They will use the information available to them plus the tool they're using to find that information on the web page.
Things such as trying to control or fine-tune exactly what a screen reader says, or make an element focusable which shouldn't be, generally lead to more confusion and worse experience for users.

## ARIA
Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about user input widgets, structures, and behavior, to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to people with disabilities.

So far we've looked at how to make a web app accessible using a sensible **DOM order**, which helps you create a logical **focus** strategy, which lays the groundwork for a rich **keyboard** experience.
Both through the use of built-in keyboard interactions and sophisticated custom keyboard event handling. Using native elements for optimal keyboard usability also gives us the built-in **semantics** used by assistive technology to present a customized interface.
But we also need to think about **labeling** controls and images and being sure to add page structure using **headings** and other semantic HTML elements to provide **landmark** information for assistive technology.
And finally the importance of **links** in creating a rich interactive experience in a complex site.
HTML comes with support for all of those things built in but sometimes it just doesn't quite go far enough.

The **Web Accessibility Initiatives Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA or just ARIA) spec** is good for bridging areas where there are a11y issues that can't be managed with native HTML.
ARIA works by allowing you to specify attributes on elements which modify the way that element is translated into the a11y tree.
**ARIA attributes** always need to have explicit values.
Adding a role attribute and an aria-checked attribute causes the node in the a11y tree to have the desired role and state, without changing anything else about that node's appearance or behavior.
In terms of the a11y tree, what ARIA does is allow you to essentially do some tree surgery.
We take the a11y tree as generated from the plain HTML tree, add ARIA and get a different a11y tree.
It may be subtly different or radically different depending on what attributes we use and where. Keep in mind that this is the only thing ARIA changes. It doesn't change anything about the behavior of the element it's added to.

ARIA attributes can be used in a number of ways to augment the existing ways we can express semantics in HTML.
ARIA can add semantics to an element where no native semantics exist. Such as a div element which explicitly and deliberately has no native semantics.
ARIA can also modify existing elements semantics within certain bounds.
ARIA can express the semantic UI patterns which don't exist in HTML.
In many cases, ARIA allows us to create accessible widgets which would not be possible using plain HTML. Please note that it's probably more work to create a fully accessible custom checkbox then to add custom styling to a native checkbox.
ARIA can add extra label and description text, which is only exposed to assisted technology APIs.
ARIA can also express semantic relationships between elements which go beyond standard DOM parent, child, and sibling relationships.
One example of a more complex relationship is something like "this controls that". It can be a button which controls whether a particular part of the page is visible or hidden in the form of the disclosure widget.
ARIA can make parts of the page live, that is inform assistive technology right away when they change.

One of the core aspects of the ARIA system is its collection of roles. A **role**, in accessibility terms, amounts to a shorthand for a particular UI pattern.
ARIA provides a vocabulary of patterns we can use via the role attribute on any HTML element.
Applying role=checkbox tells assistive technology that the element should follow a specific pattern plus we promise it will have certain states.
Since the keyboard interactions feature so prominently, it's very important to make sure that when creating a custom widget, to have the **role and tabindex on same element** so that keyboard events will go to the right place and so that when page focus lands on an element, its role is conveyed accurately.
The ARIA spec describes a taxonomy of possible values for the role attribute and associated ARIA attributes which may legally be used in conjunction with those roles.
This is the best source of truth when it comes to understanding how the ARIA roles and attributes all work together and may be used in a way that is supported by browsers and assistive technologies.
It's well worth browsing through the list of roles, since there's a finite vocabulary of roles which can be used and each one has specific semantic implications.
Certain roles are designated as abstract. These capture certain properties which may be common to several roles, but may not be used as values for the role attribute.
The ARIA spec also has a section on each role, explaining its semantic meaning as well as any associated attributes that may or may not be used with it.
The role's model includes a taxonomy of roles, including some abstract roles, which capture groups of roles with common properties but can't be used on their own.
It's definitely worth learning to navigate the ARIA spec to find out about the specifics of ARIA roles, states, and properties. But if you can find a specific pattern you want in the ARIA practices guide, then that gives you all the information you need to implement the widget in one place.

ARIA provides several mechanisms for adding **labels and descriptions** to elements. In fact, ARIA is the only way to add accessible help or description text.
To enable us to create accessible labels, ARIA provides us with properties aria-label, aria-labelledby and aria-describedby.

**aria-label** allows us to specify a string directly to be used as the accessible label. An example is where you have some kind of visual indication as to the purpose of an element but still need to clarify that for anyone who might not be able to access that visual indication, such as a button which uses a graphic to indicate its purpose. This overrides any other native labelling mechanism such as a label element.

**aria-labelledby** allows us to specify an element id to refer to another element in the DOM as this element's label. It may be used on any element and is much like using a label element with some key differences.
While a label element refers to the thing it labels, the relationship is reversed in the case of aria-labelledby. Since ARIA only affects the a11y tree, aria-labelledby by does not give you the nice label clicking behavior you get from the label element.
aria-labelledby can take a list of id refs to compose a label out of multiple elements.
aria-labelledby can refer to elements which are otherwise hidden from assistive technology.
aria-labelledby overrides all other name sources for an element.

ARIA allows us to add extra semantics into our HTML via attributes. Essentially, it allows us to modify the a11y tree without changing anything else about the page presentation or behavior.
By default, it won't affect styling nor will it affect interactive behavior. The only thing it changes is how the page appears to assistive technology users.

Always remember that native HTML elements have implicit semantics.
This means that there's usually no need to redefine default semantics and some HTML elements have restrictions on what ARIA role and attribute values may be used effectively on them.
The **ARIA in HTML spec** has a table explaining what ARIA may and may not be used with each type of HTML element.
ARIA also offers a set of landmark and document structure roles. Many of these are redundant with HTML5 semantic elements but depending on what browser versions you need to support, it may be necessary in some cases to use both an HTML5 semantic element and a redundant ARIA role.

aria-labelledby is an example of what we refer to as a **relationship attribute**.
A relationship attribute creates some kind of **semantic relationship** between elements on the page.
The ARIA 1.1 spec lists several relationship attributes. Most ARIA relationship attributes take a reference to one or more elements to create a new link between elements on the page.
What differs in each case is what that link means and how it is presented to users.
One of the most widely used Aria relationships is **aria-owns**.
This allows us to tell assistive technology that an element, which is separate in the DOM, should be treated as a child of the current element, or to rearrange existing child elements into a different order.
aria-owns can take a list of id references, so it can also be used to explicitly specify the order of children. By default, aria-owned children will come after natively-owned children.

**aria-activedescendant** plays a related role. Just as the active element of a page is the one which has focus, setting the active descendant of an element allows us to tell assistive technology that when its parent has page focus, it should be presented to the user as the actual focused element.

**aria-describedby** allows you to provide an accessible description, in the exact same way that aria-labelledby allows you to provide a label. This is a useful technique whenever
there is some extra explanatory text that a user might need, whether that applies to only users of assistive technology or all users.
One common example is a password input field, which is accompanied by some descriptive text explaining the password requirements.
Unlike a label, the description may or may not be presented to the user.
So description is a great way to communicate information, which is supplementary but not essential.

The remaining two relationship attributes are a little different and work together.
**aria-posinset** which is short for position inset, and **aria-setsize** are about
defining a relationship between sibling elements in a set, such as a list.
In the case where the size of the full set cannot be determined by the elements present in the DOM, such as when lazy rendering is used to avoid having all of our large lists in the DOM at any given time, aria-setsize can be used to specify the actual size of the set. aria-posinset can then be used to specify the position of the element in the set.

Another important technique is ensuring that only the relevant parts of the page are exposed to assistive technology. There are several ways to ensure that a section of the DOM does not get exposed to a11y APIs or is exposed only to a11y APIs.
Anything which is explicitly hidden will also not be included in the a11y tree. An element which is not visually rendered, but not explicitly hidden, is still included in the a11y tree.
One common technique is to include screen reader only text in an element which is absolutely positioned far off screen.
It's also possible to provide screen reader only text via an aria-label attribute or an aria-labelledby or aria-describedby attribute referencing element which is otherwise hidden.
ARIA provides a mechanism for excluding content from assistive technology which is not visually hidden in the form of an **aria-hidden** attribute.
Applying this attribute to an element effectively removes it and all of its descendants from
the accessibility tree with the exception of any element which is referred to via an aria-labelledby or aria-describedby attribute.

**aria-live** allows developers to mock a part of the page as live, in the sense that updates should be communicated to users in a timely manner rather than if and when they happen to explore that part of the page. An example is a status message which appears as a result of either a user action or an external event.
If this message is important enough, we can direct an assistive technology user's attention to it by setting an aria-live attribute on it. When an element has an aria-live attribute we refer to the part of the page containing it and its descendants, as a **live region**.
aria-live has three allowable values, off, polite, and assertive.

* *off* is the default value.
* *polite* tells assistive technology to alert the user to changes when you finished whatever you were doing. It's great to use if something is important but not urgent.
* *assertive* tells assistive technology to interrupt and alert the user to this change immediately. This is only for important and urgent updates.

When you're working with aria-live, verify if your aria-live region is in the initial page load. Please note that different screen readers and assistive technologies react differently to different types of changes.

There are three attributes which work with aria-live to fine-tune what is communicated to the user when the live region changes.

* **aria-atomic** indicates whether the entire region should be considered as a whole when communicating updates. Value false is the default.

* **aria-relevant** indicates what types of changes should be presented to the user.
There are three distinct options which may be used separately or as a token list.
Additions, removals, and text are three distinct op
An aria-relevant value of additions means that any element being added to the live region is significant. Value of text implies that text content being added to any descendant node is relevant regardless of whether a new element is actually added.
Value of removals implies that removing any text or any descendant element should trigger an announcement.
The default value for aria-relevant is additions text, meaning that adding either a descendant element, or adding text content through some other mechanism is significant.
It's rarely necessary to specify aria-relevant explicitly.

* **aria-busy** lets us notify assistive technology that it should temporarily ignore changes to this element.

Aria allows us to express an extremely broad range of semantic concepts via the use of HTML attributes. If you don't need to use Aria, you can just not. Implicit HTML semantics can
get you a very long way and will save you a lot of effort in re-implementing the semantics and
behaviors of many standard user experience patterns.

## Style
Without the built-in browser focus ring, it's impossible for a keyboard user to tell which element is currently focused.
The WebAIM checklist specifically states in section 2.4.7 **Focus Visible** that it should be visually apparent which page element has the current keyboard focus, as you tab through the page, you can see where you are.
Sometimes the default focus ring may not fit in well with your design.
To change the appearance of the element and only when it's focused, we can use the **:focus pseudo-class**. The :focus pseudo-class only matches when an element has focus.
To change the appearance, we can then use the **outline property**.
Removing the style altogether is a major anti-pattern, without a focus inindicator, how is a keyboard user supposed to tell which item they're interacting with?
You then need to replace it with another consistent focus indicator so a keyboard or switch device user can navigate your page. A simple solution is using the same hover and focus styles.
Browsers style the outline properties slightly differently. Use a box shadow instead of just changing the color and you'll get a consistent focus indicator across the different browsers.
If possible, leave the default browser focus ring in place, as it's what many users have come to expect.
If, however, the ring is clashing with your page styles or it's just awkwardly wrapping around your elements, then you can use the focus pseudo class to provide your own custom focus indicator
Be careful about just conveying information with color because some users may have a color vision impairment.

For native elements like button, browsers implement special behaviors to let them differentiate between mouse and keyboard focus and they only display the focus ring for keyboard focus. Unfortunately, this is not the case for custom controls you create yourself.
This behavior is also inconsistent in different browsers. Unfortunately, there isn't
currently any single cross-browser solution that will let us differentiate between mouse and keyboard focus.
In Firefox, the **:-moz-focusring CSS pseudo-class** does allow you to write a focus style that will only be applied if the element is focused via the keyboard.
There's a JavaScript shim for differentiating between mouse and keyboard input which can be used in your applications.

When you're building components, it's a very common practice to reflect the state of the component using CSS classes.
You can use CSS attribute selectors to target the element (for example when **aria-pressed** is true). This would create a nice relationship between the actual state of the component and our visual representation.
One huge benefit to styling with ARIA is that it provides visual feedback that you've applied the state correctly, which can also act as a safeguard when you're testing and debugging your code.

**Responsive design** is also a huge win for a11y.
When a page is designed responsibly, the UI will rearrange itself for smaller viewports when zooming in. This is great for desktop users who require screen magnification and it's great for mobile screen reader users since there are fewer elements to touch and explore.
Just by designing responsively we're meeting rule 1.4.4 of the WebAIMs checklist which states that a page should be readable and functional when text size is doubled.
Make sure that you're always using a meta viewport tag and that you're setting its
width equal to device-width and its initial-scale to 1.
The meta viewport tag gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and its scaling. By setting width equal to device-width we're telling the viewport to match
the screen's width in device independent pixels.
By setting initial-scale equal to 1 we're establishing a one-to-one relationship between CSS pixels and device independent pixels. This will instruct the browser to fit our content to the screen.
When using the viewport tag, make sure you don't force max-scale to 1 or set user-scalable to no. This is an anti-pattern because it prevents users from easily pinching to zoom.
Another technique is to make sure that you're designing with a responsive grid. This will allow your content to reflow when pages change its size.
A major advantage of using relative units is that text and content can enlarge and force other items down the page.
When your design is displaying on a mobile device, ensure that your interactive elements like buttons or links have touch targets that are large enough and also have enough space around
them to make them easy to press without accidentally overlapping onto other elements.
This is especially helpful for anyone with a motor impairment.
A minimum recommended touch target size is around 48 device independent pixels, this corresponds to about 9 millimetres.
Touch targets should also be spaced about 32 pixels apart, both horizontally and vertically.

**Contrast ratio** is the relationship between the foreground color and the background color in terms of luminance.
When the colors are very similar, we have a low contrast ratio.
When the colors are very different we get a high contrast ratio.
In section 1.4.3 the WebAIMs checklist recommends a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1 for all body text and images, with an exception for larger text.
This contrast ratio was chosen as a minimum because it compensates for the loss in contrast sensitivity, usually experienced by users with 20/40 vision. This vision is commonly
reported as the typical visual acuity for someone of around 80 years of age.
For users with low vision impairments or color vision deficiencies we can increase the contrast up to a ratio of 7 to 1 for body copy and 4.5 to 1 for larger text.
Using the Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools extension, you can do a page audit to verify that you're meeting contrast requirements.

There are roughly 320 million people with some form of **color vision deficiency**. This means about 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women suffer from some form of **color blindness** so it affects men much more substantially than women.
This also means that around 1 out of 20 users of your site will likely have some form of color vision deficiency.
Some information might not be conveyed to color blind or screen reader users. We should always try to provide multiple avenues for the user of your site to access critical information.
The WebAIMs checklist states in section 1.4.1 that color alone should not be used as the sole method of conveying content or distinguishing visual elements.
Color should also not be used to distinguish links from surrounding text unless they meet certain contrast requirements.
Instead, the checklist recommends adding an additional indicator like an underline to indicate
when a link is active.
You can use the **NoCoffee** Chrome extension to simulate various forms of visual impairment including different types of color blindness.
For someone with a little vision impairment **High Contrast Mode** can make it much easier to navigate the content of the page. Another good Chrome extension is **High Contrast**. It allows the user to invert foreground and background colors which may help text stand out a lot better.

There are a lot of interesting facets to accessibility worth considering when you're building your app.
A well laid out focus strategy is extremely important but without focus styling, that effort goes completely to waste.
Semantic markup is critical to assistive technology users.
With styling keyed off of semantic properties, we can ensure a consistent experience for all of our users.
Ensuring all text meets a minimum color contrast ratio is an easy way to improve readability for everyone, particularly those users with any kind of vision impairment.
Responsive design benefits all mobile device users as well as users who employ browsers' zoom.
It's important to remember that no matter what your product is, there's a whole range of users out there. Building only for a subset of users is excluding not only anyone with a permanent disability or impairment, but also means our product may fail any user when they're in a context which impacts the way that they use technology. Having empathy is a huge part of creating an accessible product. Another really important aspect is to make it part of the process from the beginning and make it part of everyone's job. Trying to make things better, remediating accessibility is best looked at through the lens of impact.

* How *frequently* is this piece of UI used?
* How badly does this accessibility issue *affect* your users?
* How *expensive* is it going to be to fix?

Good a11y = good UX!
